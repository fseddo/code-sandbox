# Authoring a system design lesson — rubric

The content standard for one page in the **System design** track. The type model + renderers are described in
[features/learn.md](learn.md); the DS&A equivalent of this doc is [learn-authoring.md](learn-authoring.md), and
the two share a type but not a shape — read this one, not that one, for a `systems` lesson.

**What the track is.** A comprehensive interview study tool that works as a *concept* resource first and an
*applied* concept resource second: every page teaches one idea to the point where the reader can defend it under
questioning, and shows it working in a real system when a concrete instance is what makes it land. It is **not**
a case-study track — "Design a URL shortener" is Phase 2 and has its own model
([improvements/system-design-track.md](../improvements/system-design-track.md)).

**Scope of one run.** One page = one concept = one `LearnTopic` file. The chapter list, slugs, and check-off
state live in [system-design-lesson-manifest.md](../system-design-lesson-manifest.md) — that manifest, not the
reference site, is what a chapter build reads.

## 1. Sourcing — the defensibility rule

The track's credibility is the whole product, so every page carries a **traceable claim chain**:

- **Primary sources win.** Vendor/protocol docs (Postgres, Redis, AWS, Kafka, RFCs), the standard books
  (Kleppmann's *DDIA*, the Google SRE book), and the original papers (Dynamo, Raft, Bigtable, MapReduce) rank
  above any interview-prep site. Cite 2–4 in `sources`, and every URL must actually resolve.
- **No verbatim scraping**, from the reference course or anywhere. The reference supplies the *outline*: which
  concept, in which chapter, in which order. Prose, diagrams, code, and examples are authored original.
- **Every number is sourced or derived.** "A single Redis node handles ~100k ops/sec", "cross-region RTT is
  ~150ms" — attach the source, or show the arithmetic in a `numbers` section. An unattributed number that a
  reader repeats in an interview and can't defend is worse than no number.
- **Name the disagreement — and verify it.** Where practitioners genuinely disagree (when microservices pay
  off; whether 3PC is ever worth it), say so and give both positions. Confident prose over a contested claim is
  the failure mode this rule exists to prevent. But **a named position must be quotable from the source cited
  for it**, and the citation must point at the page that states it. If the sources you check turn out to
  *agree*, say that — "the sources converge here" is a finding, not a failure, and inventing an opponent to
  fill a two-column table is worse than having no table. If the page itself takes the minority view, label it
  as the page's own position.
- **Vendor claims are labelled as such.** "DynamoDB offers single-digit-millisecond latency" is marketing copy
  until you attribute it; write it as *AWS documents …*, not as a fact of nature.

## 1a. Reference fidelity — staying on course

Sourcing keeps a page *true*. This keeps it *the right page*. The reference curriculum
([AlgoMaster's System Design course](https://algomaster.io/learn/system-design/course-roadmap), indexed in the
[manifest](../system-design-lesson-manifest.md)) is authoritative for **scope, altitude and order** — which
concepts this lesson owns, how deep the track goes on them, and what the reader has already met. It is
authoritative for nothing else: prose, claims, figures, examples and diagrams are ours, sourced under §1.

**Every reference lesson has a derivable URL**: `https://algomaster.io/learn/system-design/<manifest slug>`.
The manifest's slugs *are* the reference's slugs, so no lookup table is needed. A lesson the manifest marks as
**ours, not the reference's** has no counterpart and is exempt from this section — but it must still declare, in
the manifest, which reference lesson it borders, so the overlap check below has something to run against.

### The delta

The check runs twice — the **sourcer** runs it before a page is authored, and turns it into that page's scope
line; the **auditor** re-runs it against the finished page. Both produce the same three-column delta:

| Column | Question | Verdict when it fires |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Missing** | The reference teaches this on this page; we teach it nowhere. | Add it, or name the sibling lesson that owns it — **and open that sibling to confirm it actually delivers**. A deferral to an unwritten lesson is a promissory note, recorded as such, not a discharge. The test is *can a reader who has read only our chapter define this and use it?*, not *does the word appear?* — MTBF appeared on two chapter-02 pages and was defined on neither. A concept dropped on purpose is recorded with a reason; silence is a coverage hole. |
| **Extraneous** | We teach this; the reference's page has no counterpart. | Justify or cut. See the three legitimate justifications below. |
| **Shared** | Both cover it. | Say which does it better in one line, and why. |

**Extraneous is legitimate in exactly three cases**, and the author names which one:

1. **Depth the track adds on purpose** — a sourced figure, a real-system worked example, the interview angle.
   This is the track's whole reason to exist; the reference is thin here and we outrank it.
2. **A concept the reference teaches in a *different* lesson**, and the manifest assigns it to this one.
3. **Ours by design** — a lesson or section the manifest records as our addition. If the content is right
   and the manifest simply doesn't say so yet, the fix is a manifest row, **which the auditor opens at audit
   time rather than reporting as a defect**.
4. **Vocabulary a later lesson explicitly depends on.** Chapter 01's functional/non-functional taxonomy has no
   counterpart lesson anywhere in the reference, isn't a figure or an example, and was only "ours by design"
   because nobody had written the row — yet `system-design-interview-framework` names it as a prerequisite.
   A term a sibling cites as already-defined is justified wherever it is defined.

Anything else is drift, and drift is the mechanism by which a page about *what system design is* acquires four
paragraphs on the economics of the fourth nine. **The commonest drift is a page annexing its sibling's
subject** — which reads as depth while it is being written and as a chore while it is being read.

### Which does it better

For each shared concept, one line, and it is not a formality — it is where the reference earns its keep:

- **The reference usually wins on restraint and sequencing.** It is written to be read in eight minutes and it
  stops when the idea has landed. If its treatment of a concept is shorter than ours and the reader ends up in
  the same place, **theirs is better and ours is padded** — take its structure, not its words.
- **We usually win on evidence.** The reference asserts; we cite, derive, and name the disagreement. Where the
  reference states a number flat, ours is better *if* we sourced it — and if we didn't, we are merely longer.

"Both are fine" is a permitted verdict; "ours is better because it is more thorough" is not — thoroughness is
the claim under examination, not the defence of it.

**A delta with no losses in it is evidence the check wasn't run.** Name at least one concept the reference
handles better, or state explicitly that you looked and there isn't one. Two chapter-02 audits caught
themselves writing four consecutive "ours, because we sourced it" rows; both times, forcing a loss produced the
audit's most useful finding — once a correctness regression, where the reference scopes statelessness to app
servers and we had generalised it into a false claim.

**Extract the reference's real body text before comparing, and say how you did it.** The reference is a
client-rendered app: a plain fetch returns *a summary*, and a summary is always thinner than a page, so
comparing against one rigs every row in our favour. That is the mechanism behind the self-congratulation, and
it is a tooling failure rather than a wording one.

Two further failures, both seen in chapter 02, both silent:

- **Confirm the document you got is the one you asked for.** A CDN served one lesson's HTML under another
  lesson's URL — same shell, same nav, same styling, wrong body. An audit run against it would have produced a
  delta that was pure fiction with nothing on the page looking wrong. Check the `<title>` or canonical URL
  against the slug before comparing anything.
- **Some reference lessons are paywalled.** When the body is unobtainable, the honest output is *unmeasurable*
  — say so and fall back to the scope check. An estimated ratio derived from a "N min read" byline is not a
  measurement, and §1a already bars reading times as inputs.

**When your delta contradicts the brief's, the finding is against the brief.** A chapter-02 brief listed six
sections that do not exist on its reference lesson, missed one that does, and overstated the reading time by
1.5×. The rubric already says not to trust the brief's delta; record the defect explicitly, because the next
author or re-author will otherwise inherit it.

### Altitude

The reference page's length is the **altitude signal**. Ours run longer by design — evidence and worked
examples cost words the reference doesn't spend — but a page more than **2× the reference at the same scope**
has almost certainly annexed something.

**Measure it one way only: extracted body word count on both sides** — *prose only*, links resolved to
display text, excluding code fences and figure data on both sides. (On one chapter-02 page, counting the
reference's 21 code fences and 10 diagrams flipped the ratio from 1.21× to 0.82×; prose is what §1a is asking
about, because reading cost is the thing under examination.)
`estimatedMinutes` and the reference's own "N min read" are different sites' guesses at different things and
are never inputs — on one chapter-02 page they disagreed with the word count by a factor of three, in opposite
directions.

**The sourcer records how it counted, in these same terms**, so the auditor can diff method rather than argue
opinion. A chapter-02 brief put one reference at ~4,500 words when it is 1,781 — off by 2.5× — and every
downstream figure inherited the error, including the per-lesson budget the author then wrote to. A brief whose
altitude column is wrong is worse than one with no altitude column.

**An over-2× ratio with a clean Extraneous column means the surplus is §7.13, not annexation.** Say so, and
quantify it: count the words your restatement findings remove before pronouncing on altitude. On one chapter-01
page that turned a vague "too long" into a specific 315-word cut list, and the residual was the worked example
— the one thing §6a says never to cut.

This is **corroboration, not a verdict**. Check *scope* first: if we cover strictly more concepts than the
reference does, the delta's Extraneous column is the real finding and length is only its symptom. A page can't
fail altitude without failing §7.21, and a comfortable ratio is useful mainly as licence to stop hunting for a
bloated section and go look at the Missing column instead.

## 2. Lesson archetypes and depth

A lesson's part set follows from **what kind of lesson it is**, not from a single ladder every page climbs. A
uniform part list is how a page about *what system design is* ends up with a tradeoffs table: the part was
required, so something was written into it. **A part you have nothing to say in is omitted, not filled.**

### The four archetypes

| Archetype | The lesson is | Required parts | Omit unless the lesson genuinely has one |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Orientation** | *Falsifier: how many vocabularies does the page install?* One axis is Distinction; several unrelated word-lists handed off to later lessons is Orientation. A framing or vocabulary page — "what is X", "why this chapter exists". Teaches the map and the words, not a component. *Not* simply "the chapter anchor": anchor-ness is a fact about `parent`, and chapter 02's anchor is a Mechanism page. | `definition`, `techniques` (the vocabulary), `relatedStructures`, one figure, `resources` | `whenToUse` (you don't *choose* a framing), `tradeoffs`, `implementation`, `cornerCases`, **`pitfalls`** — vocabulary can't be got *wrong* in an interview-costing way, so its pitfalls come out as restatements of the thesis or as the next lesson's subject (3 of 4 bullets, on the first Orientation page audited) |
| **Mechanism** | A component or technique you can adopt — caching, load balancing, WAL — **or a property you design toward, or a failure you design against**, where the adoptable thing is its remedy (availability → redundancy; SPOF → removing it). **The default archetype**, and the one §4's full part list was written for. | `definition`, `whenToUse`, `techniques`, `example`, `tradeoffs`, `pitfalls`, `interviewAngle`, `resources` | — (`implementation`, `cornerCases`, `relatedStructures` are the Full tier) |
| **Distinction** | An X-vs-Y comparison — latency vs throughput, SQL vs NoSQL, strong vs eventual. The teaching *is* the axis that separates them. | `definition`, `techniques` + its `comparison`, `tradeoffs`, **`pitfalls`**, `interviewAngle`, `resources` | `implementation`, `example` (unless one real system makes the axis land) |
| **Procedure** | A method the reader executes — the interview framework, a deployment or migration sequence. | `definition`, `techniques` (the steps), one worked run in `example` or `implementation`, `pitfalls`, `interviewAngle`, `resources` | `cornerCases` (fold into `pitfalls`), `relatedStructures` |

The archetype is assigned in the research brief, per lesson, and the auditor checks the page against *that*
archetype's row — not against the longest one. **Checking the part list against the row is not the check** —
every page passes it, because the author read the same row. The check is the counterfactual: **name the
archetype you considered and rejected, and the part that decided it.** Every chapter-02 audit reported this as
the step that turned a checkbox into a finding, and the tell it exposes is a part that exists because a table
demanded it rather than because the lesson had something to put there.

Two falsifiers make the "omit unless" column checkable rather than rhetorical. For `tradeoffs`: *can you name
the thing the reader decides to adopt?* For `whenToUse`: *can you name what in a prompt triggers it, in words a
candidate could say out loud* — and, better still, a condition under which this is the **wrong** page? A part
that tells you when not to read it proves a choice exists.

**For `pitfalls`: can you name the passage elsewhere on the page that *fails to prevent* each mistake?** A
pitfall exists because the page taught something and a reader could still get it wrong. If the answer is "the
definition already says exactly this", the bullet is a restatement; if the answer is "nothing here teaches the
thing you'd get wrong", the bullet belongs to another lesson. Both failure modes shipped in one chapter-02
`pitfalls` part, alongside a bullet the page's own worked example refuted.

**A further falsifier, at row level, because the part-level ones cannot see the defect they miss.** For every
`tradeoffs` row: *does it name a cost stated nowhere else on the page, with a condition under which it bites?*
A chapter-02 page passed both part-level falsifiers — it had a real adoption decision and a real recognition
cue — while three of its four rows restated the `definition`, the `interviewAngle` and the `cornerCases` in
different words. `tradeoffs` is where a page goes when the author has already said everything and the table is
still empty, so it is the part that most needs a per-row test. Most lessons are **Mechanism**; if you're reaching to justify a
different archetype in order to drop a part you found hard to write, the archetype isn't the problem.

### Depth, within an archetype

- **Stub** — `definition` only. Placeholder for a lesson whose chapter hasn't been built; never the output of a
  chapter build.
- **Core** — every part in the archetype's **Required** column, with a load-bearing figure of the kind §5
  prescribes. **The minimum bar for any page a chapter build ships.**
- **Full** — adds the archetype's optional parts where the lesson genuinely has them. Aim here for
  `priority: "high"` lessons and anything an interviewer pushes on for ten minutes (consistent hashing, CAP,
  sharding, caching strategies, consensus).

**When a required part is added to an archetype retroactively, re-audit the whole page — don't append the
part.** On a page whose thesis is already stated four times, the only bullets left to write are restatements,
and that is structurally what happened when §2 gained the Distinction `pitfalls` rule mid-chapter. A part
found is not the same artifact as a part filled.

Don't fake depth, and don't fake breadth. A short honest page beats padded prose; an omitted part with a
one-line reason in the run report beats a part written to satisfy a table.

## 3. Metadata

- **`category`** — always `"systems"` for this track, including the database and networking lessons. `databases`
  and `web` stay for the standalone technology pages (`redis`, `mongodb`, `server-side-rendering`) that are *not*
  track chapters.
- **`slug`** — taken from the manifest, which takes it from the reference, so the mapping stays auditable.
  Rename only where the manifest says so.
- **`parent`** — set every lesson in a chapter to the chapter's **anchor lesson** (its first, most general page:
  `what-is-caching` for the Caching chapter, `database-types` for Databases). This nests them in `/concepts`
  ([learn.md](learn.md) → parent/child grouping) and is what keeps a 174-topic catalog navigable. The anchor
  lesson itself has no `parent`.
- **`priority`** — interview weight, not difficulty. Roughly: `high` = named in most mid-level interviews
  (caching strategies, sharding, load balancing, CAP); `mid` = comes up when the design touches it (CDC, service
  mesh, erasure coding); `low` = depth signal for senior rounds (3PC, MinHash, operational transformation).
- **`estimatedMinutes`** — honest study time, floor 10. A tight single-idea page is 10–20; a meaty one 40–60.
  It is a *study* estimate (working through tables and arithmetic), never a reading time, and it is never an
  input to the §1a altitude check. Don't inflate it to clear a floor — three chapter-02 audits found pages
  declaring 2–3× their real length, which is what made the altitude ratio unreadable.
- **`tags`** — from `LearnTag`; this track uses `distributed-systems`, `messaging`, `storage`, `architecture`,
  `security`, `observability`, `devops`, `data-engineering`, `scalability`, `networking`, `caching`, `database`,
  `api`, `backend`.

## 4. The parts, in render order

Layout comes from `ARTICLE_PARTS` — supply content per part, never headings or ordering. **Which parts apply is
§2's archetype table, not this one**: the rows below define each part's *job and budget when you use it*, and a
row's presence here is not an instruction to fill it.

| Part | Heading | Use it for | Section kinds | Length |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `definition` | Definition | What it is and the one-sentence cost model — the thing you trade to get it. Lead with the payoff. | `prose`, `numbers` | 1–2 short paras |
| `whenToUse` | When to use | The recognition cue: **what in a design prompt signals this tool**. Written for someone mid-interview. Needs a *choice* to exist — an Orientation page has none, and omits it. | `prose`, `callout` tone `tip` | 1 para |
| `techniques` *(nested)* | Techniques | The named variants, each **bold** — LRU/LFU/FIFO, round-robin/least-connections/consistent-hash. **Split the labour**: the paragraph names and defines the variants, the table carries the axes that separate them. Never state the same axis in both. | `prose`, `comparison`, `code`; also `architecture` / `sequence` **when the variants themselves are components or steps** — an Orientation page's box vocabulary, a Procedure page's step order. Not for decoration. | 1 para + 1 figure |
| `relatedStructures` *(nested)* | Related concepts | How it sits next to a sibling lesson; link with `[[slug]]`. Say what this page covers that the sibling doesn't. | `prose` | 2–3 sentences |
| `implementation` | Implementation | The mechanism made concrete: the algorithm in ~20 lines, a config excerpt, or a protocol/procedure step list. Not production code — and for a *methodological* lesson the mechanism may not be code at all. Apply §7.4's test: delete it, and if the reader loses nothing, it was restating a table. | `code`, `prose` (+ `caption`) | 1 snippet or list |
| `example` | Worked examples | **The applied half.** One real system, walked through — the flow, the numbers, what breaks. | `prose`, `architecture`, `sequence`, `numbers` | the centerpiece |
| `tradeoffs` | Tradeoffs | What you give up **by adopting this**. Needs an adoption decision to hang off; where there is none (Orientation), the cost model in `definition` carries it and this part is omitted. | `comparison`, `prose` | 1 table + 1 para |
| `pitfalls` | Things to look out for | The mistakes that cost interviews and outages. | `callout` tone `warn` | 3–5 bullets |
| `interviewAngle` | In the interview | How this actually comes up, the follow-up an interviewer asks, and the answer that shows depth. | `callout` tone `tip`, `prose` | 3–5 bullets |
| `cornerCases` | Corner cases | The failure modes a naïve design misses — partitions, cold starts, thundering herds, clock skew. Distinct from `pitfalls`: those are *mistakes people make*, these are *conditions the world imposes*. If you can't keep them distinct, keep only `pitfalls`. | `callout` tone `info` | 3–5 bullets |
| `resources` | Learning resources | Curated external links — **real URLs only**. | `resources` | 2–4 items |

`operations` and `practice` stay unused on this track: there is no per-operation Big-O table for a concept, and
there are no bank problems to practise against (Phase 2's case studies fill that role).

## 5. Diagrams — pick the right kind

The reference course leans on animated diagrams; ours are **typed data, never images**, so they stay
theme-aware, searchable, and diffable. Four kinds carry this track:

- **`architecture`** — *topology*: which components exist and what talks to what.
  `nodes: { id, label, tier, note? }[]` + `edges: { from, to, label?, dashed? }[]`. The renderer columns nodes
  left→right by `tier` (`client` / `edge` / `service` / `data`) and stacks same-tier nodes vertically, so you
  author no coordinates — only the tier assignment, which is itself the teaching. Use it whenever the lesson is
  about where a box sits in a system. **Do not use the `graph` kind** — it auto-lays nodes on a circle for
  graph *algorithms*, and reads as noise for a topology.
- **`sequence`** — *ordering over time*: who sends what, in what order. `actors: string[]` (lifelines, left to
  right) + `steps: { from, to, label, note?, dashed? }[]`. `from === to` draws a self-call; `dashed` marks a
  response or async hop. Handshakes (TLS, WebSocket upgrade), commit protocols (2PC/3PC/Saga), consensus
  rounds, OAuth flows. If the lesson's core idea is "step 3 happens before step 4", this is the kind.
- **`comparison`** — *X vs Y*: a free-form table. `columns: string[]` (the first heads the row-label column and
  is usually `""`) + `rows: { label, cells }[]`, where `cells.length === columns.length - 1`. The whole
  `Tradeoffs` chapter, every `techniques` variant table. Cells go through `renderInline`, so `` `code` `` and
  `[[links]]` work.
- **`numbers`** — *back-of-envelope*: `rows: { quantity, value, derivation? }[]`. Capacity estimates, latency
  budgets, storage math. **Every row shows its arithmetic or its source** (rule §1) — `derivation` is optional
  in the type but not in the rubric.

One diagram minimum per Core page, and it must be the *load-bearing* one — the diagram that makes the idea
click, not decoration beside prose that already said it. A second is fine when it shows a different axis
(topology *and* timing); three is usually a sign the page should split. The `tradeoffs` part's own
`comparison` doesn't count against that budget — it's the shape §4 prescribes for that part, not a third figure.

## 6. Prose rules

Same inline formatter as the rest of the bank ([renderInline](../../src/learn/article/sections/renderInline.tsx)):
`` `code` ``, `*emphasis*`, `**bold**`, `[[glossary-or-slug]]`, `[[slug|display text]]`. Not full markdown.

- **Short paragraphs**, split on `\n\n`. A wall of prose is the most common failure on a concept page.
- **Bold the named thing** the first time it appears — **write-through**, **quorum**, **head-of-line blocking**.
- **Cross-link liberally** with `[[slug]]`, and **give a forward reference a display label**. A slug whose
  lesson exists renders under that lesson's *title*; a slug whose lesson doesn't exist yet has no title to
  borrow, so a bare `[[three-pillars-observability]]` puts kebab-case in the middle of your sentence.
  Write `[[three-pillars-observability|observability]]` — the link still lights up when that chapter lands,
  and reads as prose until it does. The linter flags the bare case.
- **Second person for the reader, never for the interviewer.** "You'd reach for a queue here" is fine;
  personifying or second-guessing the interviewer is not.
- **No hedging filler.** "It's important to note that", "in today's fast-paced world" — cut on sight.

## 6a. Economy — say it once, say it fully, say it the same way

Three failure modes, all of which make a page *worse for learning*, and all of which are gated by
`node scripts/lintTopics.mjs <slug>`:

**Restatement is a defect, not a style nit.** A page that says the same thing in a paragraph and again in a
table row has not taught it twice — it has taught it once and then charged the reader a second time to
discover that. The commonest shapes: a `techniques` table restating the paragraph above it (§4 splits that
labour: the paragraph *names and defines* the variants, the table carries the *axes* that separate them); a
`cornerCases` bullet recycling a `pitfalls` bullet; a `tradeoffs` cell repeating a pitfall. When two passages
make the same point, one owns it and the other is cut — not softened, cut.

**Long-windedness is the same defect wearing more words.** A 60-word sentence, a 130-word paragraph, a
`techniques` part over its budget: each is a place where the writing stopped being read. Every part in §4
carries a length, and those lengths are budgets, not suggestions.

**But terseness that stops teaching is also a failure**, and the linter enforces floors as well as caps. A
`definition` of one sentence, a `tradeoffs` part with two clauses, a page that names a concept and never shows
it working — these fail just as surely, and they are harder to spot because thin reads as disciplined. The
balance: **cut repetition and filler to the bone; never cut the worked example, the derivation, the concrete
instance, or the reason a claim is true.** Length spent on a second *explanation* of something is waste;
length spent on the first *demonstration* of it is the page.

**Consistency is part of the design.** Every lesson on this track is one of 174 and will be read next to its
siblings, so the house shape is not optional: the parts in §4's order and semantics, the section kind §5
prescribes for each part, `category: "systems"`, `parent` on the chapter anchor, 2–4 `sources`, a
load-bearing figure. A page that invents its own structure costs the reader the orientation every other page
gave them. The linter checks all of this mechanically.

**A budget is a ceiling, not a target.** The §4 lengths bound what a part *may* cost, not what it should. Two
pages written up against every cap produce a chapter that clears every check and reads as a slog, and the caps
themselves were calibrated from real pages — so writing to them is circular. The number to aim at is the one
§1a gives you: the reference's treatment of the same scope, plus what evidence and a worked example cost.

**The linter is a floor, not a ceiling.** It catches near-verbatim restatement, budget overruns and structural
drift. It cannot catch a paraphrase that says the same thing in different words, padding that is merely
uninteresting, or a diagram that is decorative — those stay the auditor's judgment (§7.13, §7.14). A finding
it raises that you believe is *correct as written* must be justified in the run report, not silently ignored.

## 7. Acceptance criteria — one lesson

A page ships only when **all** of these hold. The auditor checks them one by one.

1. **Archetype and tier** — the page carries every part in its §2 archetype's **Required** column (Core), and
   `priority: "high"` pages reach Full where the archetype's optional parts genuinely apply. A part outside the
   archetype's set is present only because the lesson had something real to put in it. Never manufacture a part
   to clear a tier — an omission with a one-line reason in the run report is the correct outcome, and a part
   written to satisfy a table is a §7.21 finding.
2. **Cost model stated.** The `definition` says what the concept costs, not only what it buys.
3. **Recognition cue present.** `whenToUse` tells the reader what in a prompt should make them reach for this.
4. **Load-bearing diagram.** At least one `architecture` / `sequence` / `comparison` / `numbers` section, of the
   kind §5 prescribes for this lesson's shape, and it carries information the prose doesn't.
5. **Tradeoffs are real.** Named costs with the conditions under which they bite — not "adds complexity".
6. **Every asserted number is sourced or derived** (§1) — every figure the page states as true *of the world*.
   Illustrative targets and worked-example inputs (a latency budget a candidate would *propose* in an
   interview, an assumed request rate) are exempt from sourcing but **must be labelled as assumptions**, so a
   reader never mistakes a chosen input for a measured fact.
7. **`sources` has 2–4 entries**, primary-source-weighted, and every URL resolves. A claim may instead be
   attributed to a `resources` URL **provided the prose names that source inline** — `sources` is the 2–4 that
   carry the page's spine, not the exhaustive citation list.
8. **`resources` URLs resolve** and are distinct from `sources`.
9. **Cross-links** — at least two `[[slug]]` links to sibling lessons, every slug matching the manifest (a
   typo'd slug degrades silently and never recovers), and `parent` set to the chapter anchor — *anchor lessons
   excepted*, since they have no parent (§3).
10. **Interview angle** answers a question an interviewer would actually ask, with the depth-signalling answer.
11. **No duplication with a sibling.** If two lessons in the chapter would say the same paragraph, one owns it
    and the other links to it. The `relatedStructures` part exists for exactly this handoff.
12. **Every attributed position is quotable from its cited URL** — not merely plausible, and not merely
    balanced-looking. This is the check that catches a manufactured disagreement.
13. **No passage makes the same point twice on one page** (§6a). §7.11 covers duplication with a *sibling*;
    this covers the page with itself, which is the commonest form of length that isn't depth. Near-verbatim
    cases are caught by the linter; paraphrase is the auditor's call.
14. **Every part is inside its §4 length budget — floor and cap alike** (§6a). Over the cap is padding; under
    the floor is a page that stopped teaching. Neither ships.
15. **No filler.** "It's important to note", "in today's", "when it comes to", "in order to", "the fact that" —
    the linter carries the enforceable list; cut anything on it.
16. **Structural consistency** (§6a) — §4's parts and semantics, §5's kind per part, `category: "systems"`,
    2–4 `sources`, a load-bearing figure, `parent` on non-anchor lessons. This page must read as one of a set.
17. **`node scripts/lintTopics.mjs <slug>` reports zero must-fix**, or every remaining finding is justified in
    writing in the run report as correct-as-written. Silence is not justification.
18. **`npx tsc --noEmit` and `npx eslint src/learn` are clean**, and the topic is registered in
    [topics/index.ts](../../src/learn/data/topics/index.ts).
19. **No render check.** Don't boot the app to confirm it looks right — the maintainer reviews rendering. Confirm
    the section *data* is well-formed and stop there.
20. **Reference delta run and recorded** (§1a). The reference lesson at
    `https://algomaster.io/learn/system-design/<slug>` was fetched, and the page's Missing / Extraneous /
    Shared columns are in the run report. Every **Missing** row is either covered here or assigned to a named
    sibling; every **Extraneous** row names which of §1a's three justifications it claims.
21. **Nothing extraneous survives unjustified.** A section, paragraph or table with no counterpart in the
    reference and no §1a justification is cut, not shortened. This is the criterion that catches a page
    annexing its sibling's subject — the failure that reads as depth and costs the reader a chapter.
22. **Altitude held** (§1a). The page is inside 2× the reference lesson's reading time at the same scope, or
    the run report says which §1a justification buys the extra length.

## 8. Acceptance criteria — one chapter

On top of every lesson passing §7:

1. **Coverage** — every lesson in the manifest's chapter table exists, with its manifest slug, or is recorded as
   deliberately dropped with a reason. No silent omissions.
2. **Chapter wired** — the chapter is in `TRACKS["system-design"].chapters` in
   [curriculum.ts](../../src/learn/data/curriculum.ts), in curriculum (not build) order, with its lessons in the
   manifest's order.
3. **Anchor lesson** — the chapter's first lesson is its most general, and every other lesson `parent`s to it.
4. **Seeds resolved** — every "Seed / notes" row in the manifest is either harvested into the new page and the
   old file deleted, or the old slug is kept and rewritten. No stub left shadowing a new lesson.
5. **Arc reads** — the chapter's pages read in order without forward references to lessons that don't exist yet,
   and without three pages re-teaching the same background.
6. **`node scripts/lintTopics.mjs --chapter <slugs…>` is clean**, including the cross-page repetition pass —
   the failure mode that only appears once a chapter has been authored in parallel and no single author could
   have seen.
7. **Manifest updated** — every ☐ ticked, and the chapter's row in the summary table.
8. **Chapter-level reference delta** (§1a). Run the delta once more across the whole chapter, not page by
   page: a concept the reference teaches *somewhere in this chapter* must be taught *somewhere in ours*, and a
   concept we teach twice because two pages each thought it was theirs is an ownership-map failure. Per-lesson
   deltas cannot see either.
9. **Docs updated** — [learn.md](learn.md) if the content model changed at all; this rubric if a new convention
   was established.
